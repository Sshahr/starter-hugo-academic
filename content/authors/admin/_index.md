Welcome to my webpage!
I am a third-year Economics Ph.D. student at Emory University. I am working under the supervision of Dr. Karen Kopecky. Before joining Emory, I graduated from Illinois State University with a MSc in Mathematics and a MSc in Economics. 

My research interests lie broadly in macroeconomics and quantitative modeling. I am particularly intrested in studying racial wealth inequality and social security systems. I also have a growing interest in Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) models. 

In my free time, I enjoy painting, playing soccer and reading poetry. I am a huge fan of Rumi!
